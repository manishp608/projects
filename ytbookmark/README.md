# YTBookmark
- A video bookmark, seeing from tutorial freecodecamp.org.
- Hey, I tried as much as I can, but it is not working
1. For a new video, it is adding bookmarks, if delete is pressed, it is showing no bookmarks.
2. Add another, now showing previous bookmarks with the new one.
3. Reload the page, not adding new bookmarks also.
4. All of this is happening in incognito.
5. In normal one, that is also not working, nothing is working.
6. I could not find the error or mistake.

- This is a setback, but will learn more.
